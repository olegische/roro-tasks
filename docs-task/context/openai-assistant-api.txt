Assistants
Beta
Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

Get started with the Assistants API

Create assistant
Beta
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants
Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

Request body
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.

description
string or null

Optional
The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

name
string or null

Optional
The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

reasoning_effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

response_format
"auto" or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

tool_resources
object or null

Optional
A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.


Show properties
tools
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter, file_search, or function.


Show possible types
top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

Returns
An assistant object.

Query parameters
after
string

Optional
A cursor for use in pagination. after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Overrides the instructions of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

reasoning_effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

response_format
"auto" or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
stream
boolean or null

Optional
If true, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a data: [DONE] message.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
tools
array or null

Optional
Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.


Show possible types
top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation_strategy
object or null

Optional
Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
Returns
A run object.

The run object
Beta
Represents an execution run on a thread.

assistant_id
string

The ID of the assistant used for execution of this run.

cancelled_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was cancelled.

completed_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was completed.

created_at
integer

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was created.

expires_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.

failed_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run failed.

id
string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

incomplete_details
object or null

Details on why the run is incomplete. Will be null if the run is not incomplete.


Show properties
instructions
string

The instructions that the assistant used for this run.

last_error
object or null

The last error associated with this run. Will be null if there are no errors.


Show properties
max_completion_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

metadata
map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

The model that the assistant used for this run.

object
string

The object type, which is always thread.run.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

required_action
object or null

Details on the action required to continue the run. Will be null if no action is required.


Show properties
response_format
"auto" or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} } enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
started_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was started.

status
string

The status of the run, which can be either queued, in_progress, requires_action, cancelling, cancelled, failed, completed, incomplete, or expired.

temperature
number or null

The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

thread_id
string

The ID of the thread that was executed on as a part of this run.

tool_choice
string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
tools
array

The list of tools that the assistant used for this run.


Show possible types
top_p
number or null

The nucleus sampling value used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

truncation_strategy
object or null

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
usage
object or null

Usage statistics related to the run. This value will be null if the run is not in a terminal state (i.e. in_progress, queued, etc.).
